                <p>
                    Our goal is to make education accessible to children of all backgrounds, starting from small groups of people and hopefully expanding to communities world-wide. With the help of our community, we will work-together to gather resources which will be distributed to underpriviledged communities. We hope to empower the less fortunate using education, and by providing them with the same opportunities others are given. The Books Before Barriers organization believes that education should be a right, not a priviledge.

                    Since our founding, we have distributed over 10,000 books to children in 5 communities, partnered with 12 local schools, and inspired countless young readers. Our programs have shown a measurable increase in literacy rates and classroom engagement.
